# Image Processing and Dimensionality Reduction Repository

This is a repository for testing image processing techniques and dimensionality reduction algorithms. The repository includes scripts for performing various image transformations from scratch, as well as implementing dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, SVD, and t-SNE. The project is interactive through FastAPI and is documented in the FastAPI docs.


you can choose to see the sumary of the project in the notebook and pdf called sumary.

4. Activate the virtual environment by running the command `pipenv shell` in the terminal.
5. Launch the FastAPI application by running the command `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.

## Usage

Once the FastAPI application is running, you can access it through your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/docs`. This will bring up the interactive documentation for the application. You can use this interface to test out the various image processing and dimensionality reduction techniques that are implemented in the repository.
